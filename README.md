# Machine-Learning-Project-Dataset-Analysis-and-Modeling
This project implements a real-time Dynamic Pricing System for 14 urban parking lots based on occupancy, demand patterns, and competition. The goal is to develop a smart, data-driven pricing model that adjusts prices dynamically throughout the day to optimize lot usage and improve revenue potential while avoiding over-congestion.
